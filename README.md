Docker with nginx, mysql and wordpress

I use the centos image for installation of NGINX and PHP, and default mysql image for DB.

Before to use this script you need download centos and mysql 5.7 image

docker pull centos

docker pull mysql:5.7

After that you need create a dir with the name db and www_data in the path where is the script files
